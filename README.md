# IOT05-Project
IOT project for Lars Juhl. 

Project idea is a smart morning routine, where a moving sensor detects the first movement by a person, and then send different commands to several devices, fx lights to turn on, to start the radio, and to start boiling water. In addition the sensor could serve as an alarm system when activated, where the owner would receive an Email when it detects movement in the appartment.
